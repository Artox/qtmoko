QtMoko and Freesmartphone
=========================

* This is my log and notes about porting QtMoko on Freesmartphone.org
  framework.

QtMoko on SHR rootfs
====================

* In fact you can skip this step because we will do the development on PC

* Easiest way for getting started is to use rootfs from shr-project.org. They
  already use FSO for telephony and they always have most recent versions.

* For qtmoko running on SHR rootfs you need to compile with bluetooth disabled.
  I suppose you know how to build qtmoko, if not check README [1]. The
  configure command will be:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo -remove-module bluetooth

* Pack it up and transfer the contents of /opt to SHR rootfs and launch it:

../qtmoko/devices/neo/scripts/update_qtmoko

ssh root@192.168.0.202
. /opt/qtmoko/qpe.env
qpe

Develop on PC
=============

* FSO uses dbus as communication transport. Thankfully dbus calls can be
  redirected from phone to PC. Nice tutorial is here [1].

* First install latest SHR unstable

* SSH to your phone running SHR unstable and do:

dbus-daemon-proxy --system --port 8080

* On your PC do:

export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=192.168.0.202,port=8080
mdbus2 --system

  and you will see dbus interface of your phone. This interface we will call
  from our QT dialer/SMS handler etc...
