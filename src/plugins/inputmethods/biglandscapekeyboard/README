bigkeyboard for qtmoko project
------------------------------

Floating on-screen keyboard.
This is a new big keyboard with auto landscape rotation.

It is based on inputmethods/keyboard. In fact, it is
the exact same code. Just that we did the keys bigger,
layout more comfortable for fat fingers, and it autorotates
when activated.
