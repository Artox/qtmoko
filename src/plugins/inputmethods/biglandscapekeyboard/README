bigkeyboard for qtmoko project
------------------------------

Floating on-screen keyboard.
This is a new big keyboard with auto landscape rotation.

It is based on inputmethods/keyboard. In fact, it is
the exact same code. Just that we did the keys bigger,
layout more comfortable for fat fingers, and we removed
one file of keys to get space for bigger keys.

It should be useful for writting sms with fat fingers.
Also, this keyboard rotates automatically landscape,
so it is easier to press the keys.
    
When exiting from composer (for pressing send button or cancel
or whatever) the qtmoko GUI comes back again to the original
rotation up to down.
    
A video of the current implementation is here :

The keyboard is not so useful for terminal or other places,
because it use a big part of the screen. Also it does not
have control key, or alt.
