Autorotation Feature
--------------------

This program is part of the autorotation feature of qtmoko project.

The autorotation features is :

- this autorotation program
- the autorotation perl script
- the two scripts to turn on and off autorotation feature

The perl script works like this :

The scripts sleeps most of time. After 3 seconds sleeping it reads
accelerometers, doing 5 readings.

If the phone was rotated by the user it calls autorotation program
and rotates the whole QT GUI. Then the perl scripts
starts to sleep again for 3 seconds. If the phone was
not rotated by the user, then it continues sleeping.

The idea is to be quiet and dont consume any cpu, or just
a bit every a 3 seconds.
