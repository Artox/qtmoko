* disable_libmad.patch - use this patch to disable compiling libmad. Libmad is
  used for playing mp3 files. Disabling may desirable if you want to distribute
  images without patented stuff.

* qt45_passwd.patch - this patch is applied on top of QT to enable virtual
  keyboard in password input fields. This patch (or modified version) should go
  to upstream QT and then we can delete it. Now we have to apply it always when
  updating QT.

* no_voip.patch - disables voip stuff. This patch is applied for qtmoko-debian
  releases to get rid of no sound in incomming calls.
